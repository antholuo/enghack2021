# EngHack2021 FrostHound
Frosthound creates a quick and simple way to restore your applications and application settings back to the way you had them. Instead of installing each application and changing the settings one at a time. Frosthound also gives you quick and easy revisioning for your settings and keybinds, so you can restore a set of earlier keybinds if you find out that something new isn't working.
